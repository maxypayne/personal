//List. Any way you like.
//
// JavaScript Arrays can only represent lists of finite length. Your job is to implement the List class, which must be
// able to represent both finite and infinite lists. It must support the class and instance methods specified below.
// Methods must not have side effects ( mutating any argument would be a side effect ).
//
// The internal representation of List is completely free. With great power, however, comes great responsibility:
// you need to supply adequate laziness to support infinite lists yourself. E.g. [ infinite elements ].map( function )
// or [ infinite elements ].append( [ (in)finite elements ] ) should return a new [ infinite elements ].
// class methods
//
// List.empty, .iterate(fn,x), .repeat(x), .cycle(xs), .replicate(n,x), .fromList(xs)
// where fn is a function, xs is a list, x is an element (a value) and n is a number.
// instance methods
//
// list.head(), .tail(), .init(), .last(), .length(), .toList(), .get(i), .nil(), .take(n), .drop(n), .cons(x),
// .append(xs), .slice(i,j), .map(fn), .filter(fn), .reverse(), .concat(), .concatMap(fn), .zipWith(fn,xs),
// .foldr(fn,x), .foldl(fn,x), .scanr(fn,x), .scanl(fn,x), .elem(x), .elemIndex(x), .find(fn), .findIndex(fn), .any(fn), .all(fn), .the()
// where fn is a function, xs is a list, x is an element (a value), i,j are indices and n is a number (a sort of index).
// more class methods
//
// You will also need to implement some use cases of infinite lists.
//
//     List.PRIME: an infinite list of all prime numbers ([ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, .. ] )
//     You might use primes = filterPrime [2..] where filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]
//     from haskell.org. It can be written quite elegantly using List. (Don't worry too much about efficiency for this.)
//
//     List.FIB: an infinite list of Fibonacci (0,1) numbers ( [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .. ] )
//     You might use fib = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib). (Again, elegance over efficiency.)
//
// arctan(x) can be written as an infinite sum 0 + x^1/1 - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 ..
// π is equal to 4 * ( arctan(1/2) + arctan(1/3) )
//
//     List.PI: an infinite list of increasing numbers of terms (taken pairwise) of this infinite sum
//     ( [ 0, 4*(1/2+1/3), 4*(1/2+1/3 - 1/8/3-1/27/3), 4*(1/2+1/3 - 1/8/3-1/27/3 + 1/32/5+1/243/5), .. ] )
//     This one is actually quite efficient ! even though it can converge faster still with other constants. But these look nice. :P
//
// notes
//
// Unlike in Haskell, the head, tail, init and last of an empty list are defined. Also, the is defined for all lists
// ( and can be determined, except in case of an infinite list of all equal elements ).
// Diverging results and list values at out-of-bounds indices are undefined ( not necessarily undefined ! ).
// take and drop have defined results for out-of-bounds arguments, but slice does not.
// Undefined results may result in any value or action.
// All test inputs are valid and should result in a defined result.
// class methods
//
// List.empty => an (or the) empty list ( must not require () )

// List.PRIME, List.FIB, List.PI => ( must not require () )
// instance methods
//
// list.head() => the first element of list, or undefined for empty list

// list.cons(x) => x prepended to list
// list.append(xs) => xs appended to list ( equals list if list is infinite )
// list.slice(i,j) => list from index i (inclusive) to index j (exclusive) ( both arguments are optional; result is undefined for arguments not in list )
// list.map(fn) => list transformed by fn
// list.filter(fn) => only the elements of list for which fn holds
// list.reverse() => list in reverse order ( diverges for infinite list )
// list.concat() => list flattened; list must be a list of lists ( behaves differently than .concat() in JavaScript ! )
// list.concatMap(fn) => list transformed by fn, then flattened
// list.zipWith(fn,xs) => map, but with two lists ( fn will normally be a binary function )
// list.foldr(fn,x) => right-associative reduction of list to a single value ( [x1,x2,..,xn].foldr(fn,z) = fn( x1, fn( x2, .. fn( xn, z ) ) ) ) ( foldr should only recursively evaluate necessary fn arguments, as to return a valid value from a nullary or unary fn even if list is infinite ) ( not quite .reduceRight() in JavaScript )
// list.foldl(fn,x) => left-associative reduction of list to a single value ( [x1,x2,..,xn].foldl(fn,z) = fn( .. fn( fn( z, x1 ), x2 ) .., xn ) ) ( diverges for infinite list ) ( .reduce() in JavaScript )

// list.scanl(fn,x) => left-associative incremental reduction of list to a list ( [x1,x2,..,xn].scanl(fn,z) = [ z, fn( z, x1 ), fn( fn( z, x1 ), x2 ), .., fn( .., xn ) ] )
// list.elem(x) => true if list contains x, false otherwise ( possibly diverges for infinite list ) ( .includes() in JavaScript )
